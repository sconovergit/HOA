		<h3>About Us</h3>
		<p>Bayside Key is a gated townhouse community located just west of Memorial Highway off of Hillsborough Avenue in the West Tampa/Bayside area just a short walk from picturesque views of the bay. A short drive to the Town and Country area of Tampa as well as the airport and north Pinellas County with many new restaurants and shopping centers in the Oldsmar area. HOA includes community pool, tennis court, trash removal, water/sewer, building exterior insurance, lawn and escrow reserves. Elevation certificates means that there is no flood insurance requirement. Floor plans of approximately 1200 sq feet for 2 bed/1.5 bath to 2 bed/2.5 bath units. Structurally, these are 2-story, block/stucco, and wood frame combination, and were built 1995 to 1997. Community has in-ground pool and ponds on the property.	</p>
